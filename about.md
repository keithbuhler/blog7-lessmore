I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Kentucky and a philosophy instructor at Asbury University. 

My primary research interest is traditional virtue ethics. I put Aristotelian ethics in dialogue with contemporary ethical and metaphysical naturalism to see if it's possible to provide a scientifically respectable articulation of the age-old view that virtue is 'natural.'  More broadly, I have a long-standing interest in metaphysics, philosophy of mind, Plato, and philosophy of religion. 

I completed my PhD in philosophy under the direction of David Bradshaw. I also hold a master's degree in Orthodox Theology from the University of Balamand and a bachelor's in Humanities from Biola University.

My research centers on naturalism and its rivals. Currently, I am developing a novel form of ethical naturalism that builds on Philippa Foot and Michael Thompson's concept of natural norms. My [dissertation](/phd), titled "Becoming What We Are", defends Philippa Foot's ethical naturalism and criticizes that of John McDowell, whose conception of 'nature' I argue is contradictory. Virtue and especially practical wisdom are *natural*  for human beings (in a sense that I explain in detail). My future work puts Foot's "secular natural law theory" into conversation with religious theorists such as Mark Murphy, John Finnis, and Tristram Englehardt.

Over the last 15 years, I've helped almost a thousand students of all ages to learn and grow. 

Folks tend to enjoy my classroom culture, which is suffused with humor and focused on real conversations about good books. They succeed academically and grow intellectually by reflecting on great books, film, art, and their own lives.
