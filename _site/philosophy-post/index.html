<p>If you or anyone you know is taking a philosophy course this fall, this might be a useful resource.  <a href="http://www.keithbuhler.com/philosophy">The Philosophy Portal</a> is a site aimed at explaining, in my own view, (a) how to succeed in philosophy, (b) the benefits of philosophy degree, (c) how to discern whether or not to pursue graduate school, plus a few other fun links.</p>

<p>Take a look â€“ and pass it along!</p>
