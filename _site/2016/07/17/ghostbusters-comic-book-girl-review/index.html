<p>This is my first time watching a Comic Book Girl video, but everything she says about the new Ghostbusters seems reasonable to me.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQIuTGfPHvA">that hair.</a></p>

<p>Disclaimers:</p>

<p>(a) I haven’t seen the new one (but plan to).</p>

<p>(b) I liked the originals but they are not in my top 10 or top 50.</p>

<p>Was not an enormous fan of original Ghostbusters. Not that I <em>didn’t</em> like it, but I was a little young for it. Never watched ‘em more than twice. Ranks up there with, maybe <em>Speed</em> as a movie I enjoyed but did not see more than once or twice. So I don’t have a lot invested in a remake.</p>

<p>To me the trailer for the new one looked… meh. The brouhaha over the movie interests me though.</p>

<p>UPDATE I:</p>

<p>I’m watching, and very much enjoying, Ghostbusters (1984). After that, the sequel!</p>

<p>UPDATE II:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn_vAcFGTJU">Comic Book Girl did a FOLLOW-UP video here,</a> explaining why it’s important to be honest.</p>

<p>Best line: “I need to see people having fun doing this, pushing the boundaries of art… Making me think about things. See the world in different ways. And expanding my consciousness. That’s what I use movies for. It’s not just about escapism. It’s also about refining one’s soul through the process of viewing art.”</p>

<p>UPDATE III:</p>

<p>Some hot takes from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/07/21/the-problem-with-chris-hemsworths-stunt-casting-in-ghostbusters/">Stephanie Merry</a>, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/07/22/washington-post-gripes-over-chris-hemsworth-upstaging-female-ghostbusters-cast/">Charlie Nash</a>, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/07/18/milo-reviews-ghostbusters/">Milo Yiannopolis</a>, and <a href="http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/gavin-mcinnes-i-predicted-ghostbusters-would-suck-and-i-was-right">Gavin McCinnes</a></p>
