<p>One of my goals after college graduation was to read the complete works of Plato. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2ats88l">“big red book”</a>, as it was affectionately known in my <a href="http://academics.biola.edu/torrey/">honors program</a>, included spurious works that were probably not written by Plato himself but by “pseudo-Plato”, one of his students or admirers.</p>

<p>One such dialogue is <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1681/1681-h/1681-h.htm">Eryxias</a>. Eryxias is a fascinating dialogue, regardless of authorship. In it, Socrates tries to convince a few young men that <em>wealth is wisdom.</em> Failing to convince them, he presses a different thesis: even the “wealthiest” person (by their standards) is the worst off because the person with many things has many needs.</p>

<p>My summary of Eryxias’s main points are these:</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>
  <li>Wisdom is wealth, because it is useful and can be traded for food and bodily needs.</li>
  <li>Gold, silver, money, horses, etc. – things considered wealth – are useless without wisdom, because they might be just as likeley applied poorly as well.</li>
  <li>Money is wealth because it can be traded.</li>
  <li>Anything useless cannot be wealth.</li>
  <li>Useful things can still <em>fail</em> to be wealth.</li>
  <li>Conferring knowledge on someone who has money (horses, etc.) confers wealth upon them, transforming the useless things into useful.</li>
  <li>Desires are lack of something; so the greater the desires and needs, the worse off you are. “A man is best off when he is least in need of such things.”</li>
</ol>
