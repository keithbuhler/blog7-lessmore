<p>It’s summertime now, so caffeine addicts like myself sometimes don’t want a steamy cup of joe. We’d rather enjoy a cool, refreshing glass of iced coffee.</p>

<p>Why not make your own? Starbucks be darned.</p>

<p>I’ve been perfecting my iced coffee recipe now for more than 15 <del>years</del> minutes now. I’ll pass it along to you.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Brew a pot of hot coffee.</li>
  <li>Pour coffee in a glass, and add milk.</li>
  <li>Add ice to cool it down.</li>
  <li>Wait until the ice melts.</li>
  <li>Still hot? Add more ice.</li>
  <li>Sip. It’s 50% water now, so it probably tastes bad.</li>
  <li>Add sugar.</li>
  <li>Sip again. Still bad? Pour it out.</li>
  <li>Brew another pot of hot coffee.</li>
  <li>Drink the hot coffee.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
