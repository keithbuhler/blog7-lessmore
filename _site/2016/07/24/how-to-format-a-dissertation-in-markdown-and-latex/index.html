<p>I’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/keithbuhler/dissertation-story">repository</a> with my basic files to format academic papers, including dissertations. Mine is a philosophy dissertation, but this should work for any work in humanities.</p>

<p>Writing a dissertation is hard; <em>formatting</em> all that content is hard in a totally different way. The goal of this template is to empower you to format your dissertation in a way that is beautiful, clean, and (relatively) easy by taking away some of the initial missteps and allowing you to troubleshoot your way forward.</p>

<p>The template is under construction and should be finished by the end of 2016. I’m also working on video instructions on how to put all the magic into use.</p>

<p>As a taste, this is the auto table of contents generated with a single click by Pandoc+Latex.</p>
