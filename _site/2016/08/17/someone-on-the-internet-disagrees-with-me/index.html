<p>I feel so proud. Someone on the internet disagrees with me.</p>

<p>Some of you know I <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sola-Scriptura-Dialogue-Keith-Buhler/dp/1475270860/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471485271&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=sola+scriptura">self-published a book</a> 4 years ago. Mostly friends and family have read it, but I do get about 1 sale per month. God knows who is reading it and what they think.</p>

<p>Today, I got my first random email from a Polish reader who read my book and wanted to complain about a few things. He had some insightful comments and a pugnacious challenge. All good things.</p>

<p>Someone on the Internet disagrees with me! Is this what it feels like to arrive?</p>
