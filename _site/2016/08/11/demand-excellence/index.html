<p>From whom? From everyone equally? No.</p>

<p>First, demand excellence from yourself.</p>

<p>Second, demand excellence from your students, employees, children, or anyone else in your care.</p>

<p>Third, from everyone else, don’t worry so much about it. Forgive. Suffer fools.</p>

<p>&lt;–more–&gt;</p>

<p>Demanding excellence from servers, cell phone companies, or siblings is not really our place. In fact, it’s jerky.</p>

<p>But don’t let up on yourself.</p>
