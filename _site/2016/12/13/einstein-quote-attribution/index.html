  <p>“Verily verily, I say to you, there will come a time when every interesting quotation will be ascribed to me. Do not believe it.”</p>

<p>-Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Much like the piano song “Fur Elise” is attributed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4GcsUN7hlc">Bach</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGb-1ubXZ_Y">Mozart</a> (and occasionally Beethoven), every mildly interesting quotation has at some time been <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/misattributed-to-einstein">ascribed to Einstein.</a></p>

<p>Call it Einstein’s Law: The more a sentence is witty, wonderous, cute, and slightly smart, the more likely it will eventually be ascribed to Einstein.”</p>
