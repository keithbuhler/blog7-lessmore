<p>Apparently not. <a href="http://amzn.to/2giuskX">Paul Fussell</a> said class is alive and well in the US. Even you, gentle reader, cannot affirm that there are no classes at the same moment as calling some people low-class and others high class.</p>

<p>If America is not class-less, how many classes are there?</p>

<p>Fussell considers and dismisses three hypotheses:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Two:</strong> Poor and rich? Not necessarily.</li>
  <li><strong>Three:</strong> Lower, middle, and upper? Not really.</li>
  <li><strong>Hundreds:</strong> Are classes unlimited then? Not really.</li>
</ol>

<p>He says that <strong>nine</strong> classes are intelligible in the U.S. And he says that it’s not money alone that separates the classes (27). It’s also taste, style, and awareness.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Top out of sight</li>
  <li>Upper class</li>
  <li>Upper middle class</li>
  <li>Middle class</li>
  <li>High proletarian</li>
  <li>Mid-proletarian</li>
  <li>Low proletarian</li>
  <li>Destitute</li>
  <li>Bottom out of sight</li>
</ol>

<p>Our book club is aiming to discuss this book because we are fascinated by class. (He says fascination with class is very middle class!)</p>
