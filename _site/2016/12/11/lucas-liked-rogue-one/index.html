Worst case scenario, Lucas approval might mean that Rogue One somehow resembles Episode I more than VII. I doubt it, but it’s worth mentioning.</p>

<p>For the director, Gareth Edwards, having Lucas’ approval is not a necessity, but it’s certainly nice. After all, Lucas is the God of Star Wars.</p>
