<p>I teach 5 classes at two universities in Kentucky. So, after reading a lot about students on campus feeling terrible or unsafe after a Trump election victory, I decided to do my own exit poll. I asked students whether they felt generally happy or generally bad (mad, scared, sad) or generally “meh” (i.e., ambivalent, unconcerned, indifferent, apathetic).</p>

<p>Granted that Kentucky is a red state, Lexington is a blue county… Here’s the results:</p>
