<p>Peter Kreeft is a hero of mine not only for his funny lectures and crystal clear arguments but for making philosophy accessible.</p>

<p>His <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Socrates-Children-Ancient-Greatest-Philosophers/dp/1587317834/theofficiapet-20">new book</a> coming out promises to be a winner. Itâ€™s the kind of introduction to philosophy that is philosophical in form and content.</p>
