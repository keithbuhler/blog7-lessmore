<p>Father Andrew Cuneo is the rector of St. Katherine Orthodox Church in Encinitas, CA. He is a scholar of the literature of C.S. Lewis and taught literature at <em>another</em> St. Katherine – this one, <a href="http://www.skcca.edu/">St. Katherine College</a> – for the first few years of the school’s opening.</p>

<p>Except for the fact that he encouraged me <em>not</em> to go to graduate school for a PhD in the humanities, Fr. Andrew is right about almost everything else.</p>

<p>He is a wise person, an incisive intellect with a gentle heart.</p>

<p>Fr. Andrew recently spoke at another school close to my heart – <a href="pacificaoc.org">Pacifica in Orange County.</a> I’ve met most of the folks at Pacifica and they know what they are doing. Partial proof is that they invited Fr. Andrew.</p>

<p>His topic was “educating the heart”. One of the <a href="http://www.keithbuhler.com/buhlerreport/classical-education/">major distinctives of classical education</a> is exactly this: that it attempts to train young people (and all people!) as whole persons – mentally, emotionally, physically, and noetically.  You can listen to Fr. Andrew’s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnHYtD6cu60&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m31s">here.</a></p>
