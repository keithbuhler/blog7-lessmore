<p>In October 2015, I stopped cutting my beard. The reason, of course, is that <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/234783-The-Truth-About-Hair-and-Why-Indians-Would-Keep-Their-Hair-Long">hair is the organ of extrasensory perception, duh.</a> I told Lindsay I would grow it out until the dissertation was done. If some job interviews came in, I would certainly trim it back.</p>

<p>It grew wild and fierce and free. I trimmed here and there but mostly enjoyed the homeless-status-symbol.</p>

<p>The dissertation is now done. The defense is about a month away. I’m thinking that I should go big or go home. That means two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cut into a fun shape for a few days.</li>
  <li>Shave completely after the defense.</li>
  <li>Grow it out again for Movember.</li>
  <li>Trim to sensible levels in December and maintain.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is where you come in. What fun shape should I cut into? Suggestions welcome…</p>
