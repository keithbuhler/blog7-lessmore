<p>A philosophical puzzle for you:</p>

<p>Set up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alan and Alex believe P.</li>
  <li>Bettie and Bob believe Q.</li>
  <li>All four of them examine their beliefs through rational reflection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Results:</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li>Alan cannot justify P, but finds rational proof of Q, so changes his mind to Q.</li>
  <li>Alex can justify P with rational proof, so continues to believe P.</li>
  <li>Bettie cannot justify Q, but finds rational proof for P, so changes her mind to P.</li>
  <li>Bob can justify Q with rational proof, so continues to believe Q.</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alan changes his mind to agree with Bob.</li>
  <li>Bettie changes her mind to agree with Alex.</li>
  <li>Both Alex and Bob do not change their mind, and continue to disagree.</li>
  <li>All four have some rational justification for their belief.</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which, if any, is a subversive or progressive? Alan and Bettie?</li>
  <li>Which, if any, is a traditionalist or conservative? Alex and Bob?</li>
  <li>Which, if any, is open-minded? All of them?</li>
  <li>Which, if any, is close-minded? All of them?</li>
</ul>

<p>Meta-Question:</p>

<p>Do you need to know the content of P and Q before answering these questions? Is there anyway to define a traditionalist apart from the content of the tradition?</p>

<p>Is there any way to define a revolutionary apart from the content of the revolution?</p>
