(Those who already have a high grade [98+] are welcome, but not encouraged, to take this opportunity.) If you would like to earn some extra credit, here’s how.</p>

  <li><em>Option B (Moreland, Plato, Augustine, Sophie’s World) Does Platonism contradict Christianity?</em> Augustine was a Manichaean first, a Platonist second, and a traditional Christian third. He details why he thought each of these. Where do the teachings of “Platonism” differ from teachings of the historic Christian Church and where do they overlap? How does “Athens” relate to “Jerusalem”?  Does Platonism contradict Christianity? Does philosophy/science contradict theology? In your disputation, use Augustine’s arguments (especially Book VII) in either your argument or objections, and argue your answer to this question.</li>
  <li><em>Option C. (Films) Is man evolving into something superhuman or devolving into something subhuman?</em> 2001 A Space Odyssey and Wall-E present very different pictures of the relationship between man and technology. Is humanity essentially good, and becoming better? Essentially evil, and becoming worse? Essentially bad but becoming good? Essentially good but becoming bad?</li>
  <li><em>Option D (Plato, Kreeft) Do forms exist in reality or only in our minds? Are they things and concepts or just concepts?</em> Socrates argues that truly real objects he calls “forms” exist and are stable, eternal things that underly all this changing flux. However, forms are (in one sense) invisible… What is a form and why think they exist? Why think they don’t? Are the just “in the mind”? In your disputation, use Plato and Kreeft article to present your own answer to this question.</li>
