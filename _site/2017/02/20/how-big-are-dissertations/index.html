<p>My <a href="/phd">philosophy dissertation</a> was about 200 pages.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that each discipline has different standards. History dissertations tend to be longer, and science dissertations tend to be shorter.</p>

<p>The question is, how different?</p>

<p><a href="https://beckmw.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/how-long-is-the-average-dissertation/">Beck has done some of the grunt work to gather and analyze the data. (Appropriately enough, he did so while procrastinating on his dissertation.)</a></p>

<p>For example, history (275-300), anthropology (200-300), and political science (200-275) have the highest averages. Biostatics (90-120), mathematics (75-125), and economics (75-120) have the shortest averages.</p>

<p>The vast majority, as is to be expected, were between 100-200 pages. The mean was 177, median 161, with a standard deviation of 90.</p>

<p>Check out the rest of Beckâ€™s interesting data set <a href="(https://beckmw.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/how-long-is-the-average-dissertation/)">here.</a></p>
