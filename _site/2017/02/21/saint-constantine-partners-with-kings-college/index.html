<p>John Mark Reynolds, the founder of the Torrey Honors Institute (my alma mater), started a new school: <a href="http://www.saintconstantine.org/">the Saint Constantine School</a>.</p>

<p>Rather than start small, Saint Constantine has partnered for college credit with the one of a kind <a href="https://www.tkc.edu/stories/kings-announces-partnership-saint-constantine-school/">Kingâ€™s College in New York.</a> It will eventually serve K-College.</p>

<p>These are exciting times for classical education. And especially if you live in or near Sugar Land, Texas, <a href="http://www.saintconstantine.org/">check out the school.</a></p>
