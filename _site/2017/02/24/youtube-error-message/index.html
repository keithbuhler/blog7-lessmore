<p>Yesterday was one of those extremely rare moments when  Google succumbs to technical difficulties.</p>

<p>In the split second before the site was back up, I caught YouTubeâ€™s error message. This is what it said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry, something went wrong. 
A team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched to deal with this situation. 
If you see them, send them this information as text (screenshots frighten them):</p>
