<h3 id="threat-to-our-democracy">Threat to our Democracy</h3>

<p>Groups like #DisruptJ20 and the coalitions they represent are a direct threat to our democracy. They reject <a href="http://www.disruptj20.org/event/disruptj20-protest-the-inauguration-of-donald-trump/">a peaceful transition</a>. They reject civil disobedience. They want to break the law. They are not Democrats or progressives. They are anarchists.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trump’s inauguration was met with the most militant, diverse protests DC has seen in over a decade, with blockades that shut down more than half of the security checkpoints and multiple massive marches, both permitted and unpermitted, taking the streets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than 100 of our comrades were swept up in a mass arrest, many teargassed and pepper sprayed before spending the night in jail. Please donate generously to support those who put their bodies on the line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the language: “our comrades” were arrested. Not “our comrades committed felonies and were brought to justice.”</p>
