<p>Media companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter are realizing their Silicon Valley left-leaning <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2014/04/15/15-examples-of-liberal-privilege-n1824468">liberal privilege</a>.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/08/twitter-stock-plunges-as-conservatives-purged/">Twitter is doubling-down</a>, Facebook and <a href="http://www.keithbuhler.com/buhlerreport/politics/2016/12/08/conservative-worldview-google-hiring-outreach.html">Google</a> at least are trying to strike a new balance.</p>

<p>General rule of thumb (for conservatives): if <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campbell-brown-facebook_us_586fd293e4b099cdb0fcea5d?section=us_politics">Huffington Post freaks out at your hiring decision</a>, you’re doing it right. (For progressives: if <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/26/target-hired-former-la-raza-exec-board-member/">Breitbart freaks out at your hiring decision</a>, then you’re doing it right.)</p>

<p>Facebook hires a centrist Democrat who isn’t a flaming <a href="http://amzn.to/2j0FOQf">firebrand</a> and HuffPo headlines her “deep Republican ties.” Not that she is a Republican, mind you, but she has “ties.”</p>

<p>Be careful or you’ll hire someone with deep ties to the same <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/167144/wyoming-residents-conservative-liberal.aspx">center-right America</a> which has been, and is <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/america-not-moving-left-213095">likely to remain</a>, the core of American culture.</p>

<p>Which do you think media and social media companies should do to understand and represent all the intellectual diversity in the nation?</p>

<p>(a) Hire a token conservative<br />
(b) Hire an “expert” who studies conservatism but may not be conservative</p>
