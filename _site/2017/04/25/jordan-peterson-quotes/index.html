<blockquote>
  <p>Life is suffering.
Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated.
Truth is the handmaiden of love. 
Dialogue is the pathway to truth. 
Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn. 
To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small. 
Speech must be untrammelled so that dialogue can take place; so that we can all humbly learn, so that truth can serve love, so that suffering can be ameliorated, so that we can all stumble forward to the kingdom of God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In order to speak what you regard as the truth, you have to let go of the outcome. You have to think, “OK, I’m going to say way I think. Stupid as I am, biased as I am, ignorant as I am, I’m going to state what I think as clearly as I can. And I’m going to live with the consequences no matter what they are.”</p>
