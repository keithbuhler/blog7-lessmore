<p>I’d like to write a philosophy book one day trying to show that a very tiny minority of arguments validly derive their conclusion from true premises.</p>

<p>Working title: Petitio or Non-Sequitur.</p>

<p>The thesis would be simply this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Most philosophical or rational arguments beg the question, placing a modified version of the conclusion somewhere in the premises; and</li>
  <li>Most scientific or empirical arguments commit a non sequitur, merely asserting a new conclusion ex nihilo after detailing true but ultimately unrelated premises.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m not sure if this these warrants a whole book, because now that I’ve said it – that’s pretty much the whole book.</p>
