<p><a href="https://www.academia.edu/30578073/Becoming_Gods_Deification_and_the_Supernatural">David Litwa provides a fascinating (and to my mind accurate) survey of deification.</a></p>

<p>His article clarifies what the notion of “becoming god” amounts to, and explains the various species of deifiction: political deification, deification through beauty, deification as magic, deification as imitation, Christian deification, self-deification, deification through Gnosticism. This is all historically informative and very interesting; the kicker is that he accurately covers our own fashionable form of deification: <a href="http://www.keithbuhler.com/buhlerreport/singularity-chalmers">techno-deification.</a></p>

<p>Litwa’s article is a fascinating peek into human nature and will <del>instantly transform you into a god</del> illuminate you.</p>
