<p>There is a new fault line in town – the free speech fault line. Liberals and conservatives who are pro-free speech get along rather well; and both tussle with anti-free-speech advocates who think some opinions are badthink and must be silenced.</p>

<p>For a long time, the dominant distinction in American politics has been the “left/right” distinction. Politicians, voters, media conglomerates, pundits, and actors are plotted on a graph from conservative or to liberal.</p>

<p>There is good reason to be skeptical that this x-axis captures all the complexity of disagreement between various political traditions. It is easy to come up with an x/y axis graph that includes “Libertarian” as an alternative label for right-centric folks and “Progressive” as an alternative label for left-centric folks. Even millennials who identify as liberal identify as “libertarian” (67%) slightly more often than they do “progressive” (64%).</p>

<p>If this x/y graph captured all the popular political opinions, then it would make sense to have four parties. Although we have a two-party system of Republican or Democrat, each party is composed of (sizable) sub-parties who must hold their noses at the policy positions of their fellow party members.</p>

<p>For example, on the right, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/romney-and-the-gops-five-ring-circus/">Nate Silver’s Five Rings</a> divide up the Republican party into Establishment, Moderate, Christian Conservative, Libertarian, and Tea party. Tea Partiers fight with Establishment-types just about as often as they fight with moderate Democrats.</p>

<p>You can graph people’s views on individual issues
There is no comparable graph of people on the Left, but this commenter created a good start.</p>

<p>The point is that the Bernie folks hold their nose at Clinton just as much as the Clinton folks held their nose at Bernie. We are in need of a new way of dividing up groups by label in such a way as to helpfully capture their allegiance to particular ideological and policy positions.</p>

<p>Enter Free Speech.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/hate-speech-campus?redirect=free-speech/hate-speech-campus">The ACLU is as liberal as it comes, but they stand with free speech.</a> Their Q&amp;A shows how much heat they take from their authoritarian members. But ACLU is right on this one. Free speech is not a given in any society; it is an achievement of some societies. Why protect even the speech of the vilest members of our society? Because a society in which such voices are silence is, in a way, just as vile or worse as a society where those voices have a platform.</p>
