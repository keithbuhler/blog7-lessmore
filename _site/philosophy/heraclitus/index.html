<p>The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus#Logos">Fragments of Heraclitus</a> are powerful and puzzling. No one is sure of the original or meaning. No one is sure of the original order, context, and complete set. Hence, <em>any</em> presentation of the fragments, must make choices. Any choice will present some, not others, in a particular order, and thus will interpret Heraclitus.</p>

<p>Since interpretation is inevitable, each editor will interpret, and each reader will interpret; this interpretive effort is usually reserved and cautious. I thought it would be interesting exercise to go whole hog. In this interpretation I have freely interpreted the fragments we have in order to construct a (purely hypothetical) coherent unity. The result is quite obviously <em>not</em> a reconstruction of “Heraclitus,” but a kind of “found poem” of my own using Heraclitian fragments as raw material. The result is an original poem. It “flows” in a way certainly unlike Heraclitus’ original, but offers a look at what a coherent version of Heraclitus’ fragments <em>might</em> have looked like.</p>
