<p>How do you manage your time?</p>

<p>When you stop to think about it, there are only (24 * 7=)168 hours in a week. If you sleep 8 hours a night or so that’s (8 * 7=)56 sleeping hours for a total of (168-56=)112 waking hours per week.</p>

<p>What do you do with those 112 hours? The difference between King Tut and last year’s Darwin Award winner is how they spend that 112 hours.</p>

<p>If you have a job, you probably work about 40 hours a week. You might work 20 - 80 hours, but 40 is a nice round average we can work with. Supposing you work 40 hours a week, you still have (112-40=)72 hours per week to play with. Family, school, church, hobbies, sports, TV, Facebook, napping, shopping, commuting, cooking, traveling, washing dishes, and perhaps downtime occupies 72 hours; almost <em>double</em> a work week at a full time job.</p>
