<p><a href="http://www.foreigndesknews.com/world/us/al-qaeda-jihadis-target-white-americans-avoid-minorities-us-mislabels-attacks-hate-crime/">Al Qaeda’s Inspire Guide instructs jihadis to target white Americans</a></p>

<p>They say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most of the individuals present at pulse nightclub were Latino. We recommend – And Allah knows best – that it is better to avoid targeting places and crowds where minorities are generally found in America… Therefore we advise targeting areas where the Anglo-Saxon community is generally concentrated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that they don’t want Americans to interpret the attacks as “hate crimes”; they want Americans to interpret the attacks for what they are: expressions of extreme piety.</p>

<p>This means, first, that wilful ignorance about the religious element of ISIS and Al Qaeda will become more dangerous. And, secondly, that westerns and moderate and western Muslims will have to unite against not only major attacks but more such lone wolves.</p>
