  <p>Any updated variety of Aristotelianism, from the Middle Ages to the present; in particular, a strain of moral philosophy in the late 20th century that resuscitated “virtue ethics” and practical wisdom in opposition to the emphasis on moral rules and deontologism found in Kantianism.</p>

<p>Any position or view can be ‘neo-Aristotelian’ if it is a view held by Aristotle or inspired by Aristotle. Since Aristotle was the first to construct a Theory of Everything, almost any view can be neo-Aristotelian.</p>

<p>However, the term is applied more narrowly in a few different ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Neo-Aristotelian psychology (social science)</li>
  <li>Neo-Aristotelian naturalism (metaethics)</li>
  <li>Neo-Aristotelian virtue theory (ethics)</li>
</ol>

<p>This post is about 2 and 3 and their relation.</p>

<p>I explain:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the recent history of neo-Aristotelianism.</li>
  <li>the main current (and various eddies) within neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism</li>
  <li>why the theory is both a normative theory and metaethical theory.</li>
  <li>The main fault line on the concepts of reason and nature</li>
</ol>
