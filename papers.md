**"Causal Closure Agnosticism." (Revised and resubmitted)**

> Recent debates about physicalism display an increasing attention to the causal closure premise (CC).  Advocates of the causal closure of the physical appear confident that the case for CC is pretty well closed. We here dispute this confidence. It is argued that the extant deductive arguments on behalf of CC beg the key question, while inductive and abductive arguments that do not presume CC are compatible with causal openness. I conclude that causal closure skeptics and agnostics are rationally justified in refraining from endorsing causal closure and offer an alternate explanation for the confidence of CC advocates.
