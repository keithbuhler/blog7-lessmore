As per the syllabus, you are expected to attend, talk/write, and do group presentations for participation points. Every week you are expected to talk in class at least once, or post notes/reflections on the discussion board.

This paper is your final "participation" obligation. Write a paper answering the following questions in your own words (not argumentative paper, quotations are not required.)

1. Regardless of the title of this class — **Describe, in your own words, what this class was about. What are the main themes or the one overriding theme?**  

2. What was your **favorite reading or topic?  Why?**

3. What was your **least favorite reading or topic? Why?**

4. We discussed some controversial and sensitive topics.  **Did you find new reasons for a strong opinion on these topics? And did you learn reasons why the “other side” believes what they believe?**

5. What is one topic on which you **changed your mind?** 
	a. If so,  what most affected you — was it the reading, the class discussion, the lecture, the disputation writing that most changed your mind? 
	b. If not, what was the one topic that most challenged you?
