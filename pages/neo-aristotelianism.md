>Any updated variety of Aristotelianism, from the Middle Ages to the present; in particular, a strain of moral philosophy in the late 20th century that resuscitated "virtue ethics" and practical wisdom in opposition to the emphasis on moral rules and deontologism found in Kantianism.


Any position or view can be 'neo-Aristotelian' if it is a view held by Aristotle or inspired by Aristotle. Since Aristotle was the first to construct a Theory of Everything, almost any view can be neo-Aristotelian. 

However, the term is applied more narrowly in a few different ways: 

1. Neo-Aristotelian psychology (social science) 
2. Neo-Aristotelian naturalism (metaethics)
3. Neo-Aristotelian virtue theory (ethics)

This post is about 2 and 3 and their relation. 

I explain: 

1. the recent history of neo-Aristotelianism. 
2. the main current (and various eddies) within neo-Aristotelian ethical naturalism
3. why the theory is both a normative theory and metaethical theory. 
4. The main fault line on the concepts of reason and nature
