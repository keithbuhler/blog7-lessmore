Most college students will take exactly *one* philosophy class. [You should make the most of it.](/philosophy) 

[Philosophy can help you to find a good job, earn a higher salary than a business degree, become fully human, and find answers to life's deepest questions.](/philosophy-3-major)


If you do take a class, you might find it surprisingly good -- depending on the professor, of course. (A bad professor could make *Disneyland* boring.) 

Why is philosophy interesting? Perhaps because it invites you to think deeply about your life and your world, about reality, death, meaning, science, religion, and beauty. Everyone has opinions. Philosophy invites you to reflect, learn from others, and grow.
