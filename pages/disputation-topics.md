# Morality and Society Topics (UK 2017)

## Unit 1. (Nature of Morality) 

**Is the moral law a law of nature or a social convention?** 

If morality is not merely an illusion, then it is either a law of nature discovered by humans (like rules of mathematics or logic) or a convention created by humans (like the rules of spelling or and baseball). Pojman, Hobbes, and Kreeft argue that morality is *useful* for keeping society together, reducing suffering, and promoting flourishing. But Pojman seems to think morality is *merely* useful (and not real), where Kreeft argues that it is *both useful and real* -- or perhaps useful because it is real. Using examples from *Lord of the Flies*, "Billy Budd", "Illustrations of the Tao" or others from the texts, argue for one of these two claims. 

## Unit 2 (Moral Theories) 

**Option A - Which moral theory is most useful?**

One's morality is a combination of "gut" feelings, parental training, social and cultural convention, personal habits, and moral theory. Moral theory -- or philosophical ethics -- cannot replace one's lived moral but it can help to prune and grow it. We discussed six related but distinct moral theories: utilitarianism, Kantian deontology, divine command theory, virtue ethics, stoicism, feminism/ethics of care. Which of the six moral theories do you find most useful and persuasive? Discuss how that moral theory helps you know what to do in a particular moral example,  such as the Ring of Gyges, the Good Samaritan, Lord of the Flies, Billy Budd, the Longboat, etc. For your objections section, state the "second best" or runner up moral theory. In your "replies" section show how the "runner up" gives an inadequate response  to this example and how your theory gives a more adequate response.

**Option B -- Does Virtue Ethics provide clear enough guidance?**

William Frankena critiques virtue-based ethical systems while Williams defends virtue. Jesus commends virtue-talk in the Sermon on the Mount, and the Stoics commend virtue-talk in their catechism. One of Frankena's most cutting criticisms is that virtue theories don't provide clear action guidance. Is this true? State both sides of this issue and defend your answer, either 'yes' or 'no.'

## Unit 3 (Moral Issues) 

**Option A -- Does religion give meaning to life?**

The Voltaire Brahmin story shows the tension between wisdom (which brings undesirable suffering) and undesirable ignorance (which brings contentment). Similarly, Camus' Myth of Sisyphus describes how intolerably futile and pointless life feels when we reflect on the inevitability of death. By contrast, Pojman argues that theistic religion (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, etc.) gives meaning to life. Does religion give meaning to life on earth? State both sides of this question and defend your thesis, either yes or no. 


**Option B -- Is morality in your best interest?**

Ayn Rand argues that traditional altruistic, self-sacrificial "morality" is anti-life, suicidal, irrational, and immoral. Instead, she presents the rational morality of egoism, pursuing one's own interests, protecting one's own life. Pojman and Rachels criticize Rand's argument by urging that self-sacrifice and altruism can be sometimes good, rational, and moral. Argue for or against the view that it is moral sometimes to be altruistic and self-sacrificial sometimes even at the cost of your own self-interest (or that altruism/self-sacrifice is truly in your best interest anyway). Make sure to state reasonable objections for the opposite view, and argue your thesis. 

## Unit 4 (Moral Problems) 

****Option A -- Is abortion morally permissible?** 

Thomson argues that abortion is morally permissible even if the fetus is an individual human being because a woman must give permission before another person has the right to bodily space, just like you have the right to "unplug" a famous violinist from your liver. And Marquis argues that abortion is impermissible even if the fetus is not an individual human being because the fetus has a future that we cannot deprive it of. Who is right? Comment on these arguments or build your own case for or against some or all abortions. 

**Option B -- Is homosexual sex morally permissible?**

Levin argues that homosexual sex (he does not discuss feelings, identities, attractions, or homosexual orientation itself) is abnormal because it violates natural usage of body parts. Corvino argues that there is no good reason why two gay men (etc.) in a committed relationship shouldn't have sex for the relational benefits it brings. Who is right? Comment on these arguments or build your own case for or against some or all LGBT sexual activities. 

**Option C -- Is euthanasia morally permissible?**

Gay-Williams argues that euthanasia is wrong because it involves the deliberate killing of an innocent person and that it will lead to further negative consequences. Brock argues that euthanasia is not wrong because it is not morally different from the sort of 'letting die' that is already legal and that it will not likely lead to further negative consequences. Who is right? Comment on these arguments or build your own case for or against some or all euthanasia.

# Business Ethics Topics (Spring 2017)

## Unit Paper 1 (Moral Theories) Which moral theory is most useful? 
One's morality is a combination of "gut" feelings, parental training, social and cultural convention, personal habits, and moral theory. Moral theory -- or philosophical ethics -- cannot *replace* one's lived moral but it can help to prune and grow it. 

Five ethical theories that we discussed help us to reflect on our morality. These are related but distinct: utilitarianism, Kantian deontology, divine command theory, virtue ethics, common sense intuitionism. Which of the five moral theories do you find most useful and persuasive? 

For your objections section, state the "second best" or runner up moral theory. In your "replies" section show how the "runner up" gives an inadequate response  to an example and how your theory gives a more adequate response.

In your argument section, show how your moral theory helps you know what to do in a particular moral example from Audi's "Place of Ethical Theory" chapter, such as affirmative action, whistle-blowing, or advertising and the ethics of creating desire. 


## Unit Paper 2 (Capitalism and Socialism) Is CEO Pay ever unjustifiably high? 

This Unit Paper is about CEO compensation in the context of a capitalist society where entrepreneurs are paid with cash, bonuses, stocks, and "golden handshakes." Many people are uncomfortable with high CEO compensation -- in this paper, try to answer the question of whether or not it is possible that their pay is too high. 

This is a yes/no question. So answer the question! Don't say you "see both sides." ARGUE ONE SIDE, even if you're not 100% sure about it. For example:  Yes: If you argue that CEO compensation is sometimes too high, state in your objections section the single best reason to think that CEO pay is just. Then explain, in the argument section,  when and why a certain amount is unjust. No: If you argue that CEO compensation is never too high, state in your objections section the single best reason to think CEO pay is sometimes unjust. Then explain, in the argument section, why even high amounts are just. 


## Unit Paper 3 (Moral Law) - Is the moral law objective or convention?

If morality is not merely an illusion, then it is either a law of nature discovered by humans (like rules of mathematics or logic) or a convention created by humans (like the rules of spelling or and baseball). Certainly, morality is *useful* -- useful for keeping society together, reducing suffering, and promoting flourishing. But is it real or merely conventional?  Using examples such as illustrated in the Tao, the Inside Job, or other readings, argue for one of these two claims. 


## Unit Paper 4 Option A (Incentives) -- Is small information and small money lobbying the only acceptable form of lobbying? 

Is the author (Andrew Stark) correct that small info and small money are the only morally acceptable forms of lobbying since they have the least risk of corruption? 


## Unit Paper 4 Option B (Deception) -- Is it ever permissable for businesses to deceive? 

Is it ever morally permissible for a business to tell an untruth, a partial truth, or a combination of truth and BS? If so, when? If not, why not?


## Unit Paper 5 Option A (Affirmative Action) -- Is affirmative action for black Americans the only morally acceptable form? 

Is the author (Bernard Boxill) correct that affirmative action on behalf of black folks is only morally acceptable form of affirmative action, since diversity of other cultures at the top would not secure social stability?

## Unit Paper 5 Option B (Safety) -- Do businesses have an obligation to provide safe products? 

Is the author (Hasnas) correct that businesses do not have an obligation to provide safe products to the public but only to communicate the level of danger?

# Introduction to Philosophy Topics  (Spring 2017)

## Disputation, Unit 1. (Origins) Is Christian belief primarily supported by faith or by reason? 
Three core Christian beliefs are that God exists and created the world, that all men are sinful, and that Christ died and rose again for our salvation. JP Moreland argues that non-Christians (as well as anti-intellectual Christians) have a secular view of knowledge. Using one or more of these three doctrines as examples of “Christian belief”, summarize whether Christians accept this/these belief(s) because of faith or reason. Summarize in the “objections” section at least one reason to accept the opposite of your thesis. You are free to argue that these beliefs are supported by both faith and reason, but you must answer the question about which one is primary. 

## Disputation, Unit 2.  (Socrates) Does philosophical conversation (dialectic) harm or benefit young people? 
Socrates is accused of “corrupting the young” probably because he engages them in philosophical conversation (dialectic). According to Kreeft, philosophical conversation is ignorant, poor, and foolish but also misunderstood, happy, pious, and death-defying. The dangers of philosophical conversation include that it might disobey the Fifth Commandment (honor thy father and mother), subvert irrational traditions, or just plain hurt your feelings. The opportunities of philosophical conversation include that it might obey the First Commandment (love God), strengthen rational traditions, and humble your mind. So, using Socrates Apology (and others) as an example, argue either that dialectic is harmful for the young or that it benefits the young.

## Disputation, Unit 3, (The Soul) Does the soul die with the body or live on?
Socrates provides three arguments (plus a fanciful story) to convince Simmias and Cebes that death is not the end: including what we label the "Argument from Opposites," the "Argument from Recollection," and the "Argument from Affinity (to Forms)”. Is the soul immortal? Summarize at least one argument from the text (either as an objection or argument) and argue for your answer to this question.
 
## Disputation, Unit 4, (Logic) Is all truth subjective or is some truth objective? 
Kreeft shows how traditional logic and language indicates that reality is real and independent of the thoughts and opinions of human beings. Nevertheless, truth is difficult to attain. People disagree. Opinions vary. There is no accounting for taste. Everyone agrees that some truths are subjective. Are all truths subjective? Or are some objective? Use Peter Kreeft's book on logic (and possibly Plato, Moreland, etc) to argue either that *no* truth is objective or *some* truth is objective. 

## Disputation, Unit 5 (Augustine) Is evil a substance or merely a privation of goodness? 
One of Augustine's big concerns is evil and goodness. He calls the Christian God good from the very first page, and says he struggled with how to understand evil. Does it exist? Certainly some people are evil (satan, Stalin) and some deeds are evil (like Augustine’s stealing the pear) but is evil a substance or the privation of goodness?  Use Augustine’s arguments (especially Book VII) either in your arguments or objections, and argue your thesis answering this question.
